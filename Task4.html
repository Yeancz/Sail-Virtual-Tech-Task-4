        <p>Hi! My name is Adeyinka and I'm trying my hands at this thing called coding. I did a <b>CSC</b> course in school but.......I hated it. I couldnt learn anything and I barely passed the exam back then</p>
        <p>You're probably wondering why I'm doing this now if I hated it so much in school. Well let's just say I've seen the light hehehe. I just started coding but I already have a story to share.</p>
        <p>I was coding in the bus yeah I know not smart at all. I've learnt my lesson. Long story short I was so engrossed with what I was doing I got down at the wrong bus stopðŸ˜©</p>

        <p>Tech space is a large space there are lots of things one can learn and do when choosing tech as career</p>
        <p>I made some research and I decided to go into web development and as a beginner choosing the best coding path that won't overwhelm me is important.</p>
        <p>I chose these 3 paths below to start with. They seemed like the best for a novice like me.</p>
       <ul>
           <li>HTML</li>
           <li>CSS</li>
           <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
       </ul>

    <div class="table">
      <h3 class="schedule">My Coding Schedule</h3>
      <p>I'm a bit of a procastinator and I know it won't help me in this journey. For each task I decide upon I always try to find a way to cope with procastination.</p>
      <p>So I decided to create a schedule to help me battle this bad habit and also keep myself on track.</p>
      <p>My schedule or timetable is below. I have periods for learning, coding and discussing with people about coding or just reading online. I also gave myself break time.</p>

            <h4 class="video">My Media (Video)</h4>
            <p>This is my favorite video on Youtube right now. The artist is Agust D AKA Suga of the Kpop group BTS. He is my ultimate bias among the 7 members and the title of the song is 'Daechwita'</p>
            <p>I'm not really a Kpop person I'm more of a Kdrama stan but last year I while watching different video on Youtube I stumbled on few of their videos interacting with each other and I got hooked.</p>
            <p>I won't say I'm their fan yet cos I only know 2 or 3 of their songs but I like the boys as individuals not celebrities.</p>

            <h5 class="audio">My Media (Audio)</h5>
            <p>I have 3 artists that I can listen to non stop Sia, Adele and Asa. They are my musical goddesses my playlist trinity.</p>
            <p>My favorite songs right now is from Asa's new album 'V'. This album is pure magic quite different from Asa's usual style and there are other artists featured on it which is also a first for Asa.</p>
            <p>Every song on it is a hit but then everyone has their fave track. Mine is a struggle between Ocean and Show Me Off but I will go with Ocean cos of Wurld voice in the background.</p>
